Layers:
1: application-protocols, applications (dhcp, firefox)
2: presentation-standardization; emails for example.  security features (https). Translator.
3: session-creates the connection between computers.  After connecting, breaks data into packets
4: transport-TCP or UDP
    TCP-Transmission Control Protocal-constant connection, designed for reliability/consistency
        plus-accurate, synchronization, reliability
        minus-reliable connection req'd, slow connection can bottleneck, slower than UDP
    UDP-User Datagram Protocol-no error checking, no snynchornization, no guarantee; 
        plus-fast, allows application layer control over packet send rate, no continuous connection
        minus-doesn't care if data received, unstable connection makes it awful
        mostly used for small amounts of data
5: Network-responsible for routing the data.
    -OSPF (open shortest path first)
    -RIP (routing information protocol)
    everything is dealt with using IP addresses
6: data link-receives packet from the network layer, adds MAC (media access control) of receiver
    Uses NIC (network interface card)
    responsible for making sure data formatted
7: physical-cables and devices
