Connection-based; can be slightly more resource intensive
lots of headers:
    1) source port
    2) destination port
    3) source IP
    4) destination IP
    5) sequence number (random initial seed)
    6) acknowledgment number (next piece has sequence number+1)
    7) checksum
    8) data
    9) flag

3-Way handshake
    1 syn-first packet sent by client
    2 syn/ack-server response
    3 ack-used by either the acknowledge receipt.

For termination:
    1 fin
    2 fin/ack
    3 ack
