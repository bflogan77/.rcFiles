-program headers: required.  THE source of information used when loading a file.
    INTERP: defines library to load the ELF
    LOAD: defines the part of the file to be loaded into memory
-section headers: not required; kind of used for readability
    .text: the executable code of teh program
    .plt and .got: used to resolve and dispatch library calls
    .data: used for pre-initialized global variables (e.g. global arrays w/ initial data)
    .rodata: used for gloabl Read-Only data (e.g. string constants)
    .bss: used for uninitialzied global writable data (e.g. global arrays w/o initial data)

-Interacting w/ ELF's
    gcc-to make it
    readelf-to parse the ELF header
    objdump-to parse ELF header and disassemble source code
    nm-to view ELF's symbols
    patchelf-to change some ELF properties
    objcopy-to swap out elf sections
    strip-to remove otherwise helpful information (such as symbols)
    katai-struct to look through elf interactively
